# The following two rules have been particularly noisy as of late and doing some research shows that it is mostly automated processes between a workstation that 
# locally stores a user's roaming profile for the domain it is joined to and the domain controller. These alerts will generate any time a password reset disk is made,
# and the backup of the master key is an automated process that provides no real live security screening other then troubleshooting the programs that use it to encrypt
# files. Microsoft also states as listed below the rules that it hold no real value. I recommend these two are disabled.

# Champ Clark III - Removed Account Name of machines - 2018/10/20
# We may want to review this change. 

# This rule used a pcre of "/^((?!Account Name: (.*)\$ ).)*$/"; When dealing with large strings, this pcre cause a fault. 
# This is likely due to a libpcre match recurision issue (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27868180/preg-match-appears-to-hit-a-limit-when-using-two-matches).
# I re-wrote the rule to exclude pcre all together.  See issue https://github.com/beave/sagan/issues/122
