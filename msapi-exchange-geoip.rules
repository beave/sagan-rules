# These rules work best with a JSON input map.  See the "msapi" mapping.  See the Sagan
# JSON documentation for more information
#
# For some reason,  Microsoft decided with the "ClientIP" to make the value inconsistent.  It might be
# 192.168.1.1 (which is great), or "[192.168.1.1]:1234" or "192.168.1.1:1231", etc.  This only allows 
# us to lookup certain types of Exchange events.   Might want to revisit this later.
