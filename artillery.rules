# "Artillery" is a project by TrustedSec that monitors, detect & block attacks.  It is written in Python
# and acts as an HIDS system.  Artillery has the ability to write to local or remote syslog servers.  These
# Sagan rules trigger when Artillery detects something bad.  These rules also act as a "gateway" between
# Artillery and Snort consoles (Snorby/Sguil/etc).
# 
# From the Artilley Website: "The purpose of Artillery is to provide a combination of a honeypot, file-system 
# monitoring, system hardening, real-time threat intelligence feeds, and overall health of a server to create a 
# comprehensive way to secure a system.
# 
# Artillery is written by Dave Kennedy and the TrustedSec crew (@HackingDave / @TrustedSec).  For more 
# information about Artillery,  see https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/artillery/
