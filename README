Welcome to the "Sagan Rules" README file
----------------------------------------

This is the Git repository for the Sagan engine rule sets.  You 
probably won't find these useful unless you're actually using Sagan!

What is Sagan? 
--------------

Sagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log 
analysis & correlation engine.  It is written in C and uses a 
multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event 
analysis. The Sagan structure and Sagan rules work similarly to the 
Sourcefire "Snort" IDS engine. This was intentionally done to maintain 
compatibility with rule management software (oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc)
and allows Sagan to correlate log events with your Snort IDS/IPS 
system. Since Sagan can write to Snort IDS/IPS databases via 
unified2/barnyard2, it is compatible with all Snort "consoles". For 
example, Sagan is compatible with Snorby [http://www.snorby.org], 
Sguil [http://sguil.sourceforge.net], BASE, and the Prelude IDS 
framework! (to name a few).

Sagan supports many different output formats,  log normalization 
(via liblognorm),  script execution on event and automatic firewall
support via "Snortsam" (see http://www.snortsam.net).
